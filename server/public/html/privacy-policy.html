      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>This webODV Explore site requires login via your D4Science account or by

        site as a named user.</p>

      <p><b>What information do we collect?</b></p>

      <p> We collect anonymized usage statistics using the Matomo software running 
        at the Alfred Wegener Institute. In addition, when you are exiting a data 
        exploration session we log a usage record containing the connection IP address 
        and the session duration. Private views and settings are stored in your 
        browser's data, not on our server. Note that such private content is lost 
        when you clear your browser data.</p>

      <p><b>What do we use your information for?</b></p>

      <p>The sole purpose of the logged usage records is to monitor usage of this 
        webODV Explore site. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside 
        parties the logged usage records.</p>

      <p><b>Your consent</b></p>

        this page. This policy was last modified on 2024-04-01.</p>
